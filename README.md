The purpose of this project was to preform an exploratory data analysis on the automobile dataset. The data that is being analysed is the automobile.txt file which can be seen in the project folder. The data was cleaned, missing data was dealt with and visualisations were created in the Jupyter notebook called automobile.ipynb.  All the main findings can be found in the EDA pdf.
